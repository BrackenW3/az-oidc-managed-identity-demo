# GitHub Actions with federated credentials to user-assigned managed identity

Demo project to test the viability of using user-assigned managed identites instead of service principals for authentication for GitHub Actions.

## Motivation

- Managed identities can't have secrets as credentials ðŸ”’
- Managed identities can be created declaratively with Bicep / via resource manager API ðŸ˜Ž
- Federated credentials allows for more granular restrictions on the identity's use (e.g. specific branches or environments) âœ…
- Avoid issues with short-lived tokens for federated credentials on service principals (for long running jobs) ðŸ•¥

## Steps

1. Fork this repo

2. Run this deployment locally:

```powershell
Connect-AzAccount

$ghUserName = '<your github user name>'

New-AzSubscriptionDeployment -Name "demo-mi-gh" -Location norwayeast `
    -TemplateFile ./bicep/main.bicep -ghUserName $ghUserName
```

This will deploy the [main.bicep](./bicep/main.bicep) that contains a resource group with a managed identity with a federated credential and a role assignment. Make note of the output values for subscription id, client id and tenant id.

3. Add these values as secrets to your GitHub repository with the secret names `SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `CLIENT_ID`, `TENANT_ID`.

4. Trigger workflow by navigating to Actions and choosing the "Run Azure Login" workflow

## Cleanup

Delete the resource group including the managed identity and its credentials by running:

```powershell
Remove-AzResourceGroup -Name "demo-mi-gh-rg"
```
